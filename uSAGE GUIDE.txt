How to use the program:
1. If the user is on a windows platform, perform the following steps:
	 i) Create a project using code blocks.
	ii) Copy the 3 files: header.c, main.c, implementation.c into the project folder. 
   iii) Using code blocks Add files to the project from the project menu.
    iv) Compile and run
2. If the user is on an ubuntu platform, perform the following steps:
     1) Move to the appropriate folder.
	 2) Run the make command
	 
Once the user runs the file on either platform, he/she is given a choice.
The user can choose from 4 input files provided.
The smallest file contains about 15 lines of data
The normal file contains about 50 lines of data
The big file contains about 6000 lines of data
The biggest file contains about 8000 lines of data

After the index is formed for the chosen file, The user can now choose the number of words the index is required for.
Once the user enters all the required words, 3 retrieval algorithms are called. 
1. Without any Indexing
2. With Standard Reverse Indexing
3. With Modified Reverse Indexing

The time taken to retrieve each word through different retrieval algorithms is displayed along with the position of the entered word.


Note: The position is defined by the paragraph number and the line number
